## Notes

Some challenges I faced while building this app was the dark and light mode. I was able to apply it to the settings page but I found it difficult to implelment on the main view page for the switch was on the settings page; I hope to learn how to do these types of actions during the course. Another challenge I faced was adding constraints, for even after I added them, I continued to recieve errors. If I had more time, I would have loved to add some animation and a custom keyboard.
